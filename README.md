# DinnerReady
DinnerReady is a mobile app created using React Native and Firebase.
DinnerReady enables families to be more organised when having family meals.
Families create a family account and can plan in advance when they will be in attendance or not.
Family admins can send out reminders for members to register their attendance.
Therefore, whoever is cooking the dinner can know exactly how much to make!

## Why did I create DinnerReady?
In my household, there are 5 of us. Regularly, one or more of us will not be in attendance for dinner.
This has meant that sometimes, too much food has been cooked and goes to waste.
I wanted to create a solution that would easily allow us to register our attendance in advance, therefore preventing food waste and unneccessary annoyance.
Additionally, it allows whoever is cooking to easily request the family to let them know if they will be there or not.

## Tech Stack
- **React Native**: React Native allows for cross platform development. I am well experienced in React Native and wanted a project that I could publicly list on my portfolio.
- **Firebase**: Firebase provides an easy to implement backend and provides all the features which I need. This includes a database, authentication and push notifications.
